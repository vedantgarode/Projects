<h1>MISSION & PHILOSOPHY</h1>
<h3>AN EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND RESEARCH-BASED, INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH TO EARLY CHILDHOOD AND BEYOND</h3>
<p>The Seven Arrows Way of Education acknowledges children as strong, capable, resilient, and full of wonder and knowledge. Every child brings with him or her a deep curiosity and potential. We combine an appreciation of beauty and multiculturalism with a disciplined academic program rooted in math and science. Our goal is to help children become trusting, independent thinkers who display self-knowledge, respect, and empathy for other people. In early childhood, play is the best way to harness the learning power of children, stimulate creativity, and heighten retention.
</p>
<p>
The Seven Arrows Way is based on the profound pedagogy and philosophy of Experiential Learning. We ground our educational approach in leading-edge brain research. The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, developed at Harvard University by cognitive scientist Dr. Howard Gardner, holds that different people have diverse ways of learning, remembering, performing, processing, and understanding information. Gardner posits that there are seven distinct intelligences: Visual-Spatial, Bodily-Kinesthetic, Musical, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, Linguistic, and Logical-Mathematical. Our curriculum is designed to explore these intelligences, and to identify each child’s individual learning style, in order to optimize his or her educational results.
</p><p>
We also draw upon Dr. Richard Davidson’s research in affective neuroscience, which focuses on how a child’s emotional state affects the way he or she absorbs information. He enumerates six significant factors determining learning success:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Resilience: how slowly or quickly one recovers from adversity.</li>
<br>
<li>Outlook: how long one is able to sustain positive emotion.
</li><br>
<li>
Social Intuition: how adept one is at picking up social signals from those around you.
</li><br>
<li>
Self-Awareness: how alert one is to the physical signals that accompany emotional states.
</li><br>
<li>
Sensitivity to Context: how good one is at regulating emotional responses depending on environment.
</li><br>
<li>
Attention: how sharp and clear one’s focus is.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We employ Davidson’s strategies to identify each child’s unique patterns, helping them to become aware of themselves and of others and readying them to learn. We continue to refine our practices by actively engaging with a wide variety of experts in the field, including Dr. Carol Dweck, Dr. Martin E.P. Seligman, and Dr. Daniel Goldman. We strive to recognize what makes each of our children unique and foster their strengths and address their weaknesses accordingly.
</p>
<p>
We are a community of lifelong learners, and encourage teachers and parents to continue their own growth. We foster this with ongoing professional development for our teachers and a robust expert speaker series and parenting library for our parents.
</p>
<h3>CORE VALUES</h3>
<p>
Our core values Curiosity, Creativity, and Community are woven into every facet of our curriculum and fostered by every member of our school. Our hands-on, experiential learning and engaging approach promotes individual growth and achievement while also emphasizing social responsibility and good citizenship.<p>
<h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
<p>
Little Dolphins is a pre-school that recognizes that the arts are fundamental to the development of children. Little Dolphins was founded to promote early imaginative learning through hands-on experiences in visual art, theater and music for the purpose of fostering understanding through cultural enrichment.

<h1>ORIGIN STORY</h1>
<h3>A HISTORICAL TIMELINE</h3>
<p>Little Dolphins was born of the desire to elevate the level of early childhood education in Los Angeles. What started in a "schoolhouse" (the home garage of our founder, Margarita Pagliai) has now become a way of education, dedicated to a multicultural curriculum that exposes children at an early age to the differences in our world.<p>

<p>I began my journey at Little Dolphins 22 years ago as the parent of a 4-year-old, and in the span of that year, I fell in love with this way of early childhood education. With a professional background in the arts, I knew I wanted to be part of a community that nurtures a child’s creativity and imagination through art, music and folk tales from around the world. It was inspiring to see that a rich arts-based curriculum along with the immersion into a different culture each month had a profound impact on children at this tender age; giving them a sense of wonder, curiosity, and respect for others. Throughout the ensuing years, I have dedicated myself to continuing this hands-on approach to education by developing an after school enrichment program, teaching art classes, and acting as art consultant to keep the aesthetic vision of the school alive and growing. I believe that as early childhood educators, we have the opportunity to create an excitement for learning that lasts a lifetime. My 4 year old Little Dolphin is now 26 years old and she credits her confidence and ability to think creativity to her experience all those years ago at Little Dolphins By The Sea.
</p>
<p>
I received a B.A. in fine arts from Binghamton University, New York. I have worked in the areas of textile design, photography and children’s art education and co-authored a children’s art book, titled P is for Peanut, for the Getty Museum. I am the mother of two grown children (the most fulfilling job!) and live in Pacific Palisades with my husband, David Schwartz, and dog, Banjo.</p>

<h3 style="text-shadow:2px 3px 4px;">MARI-JO DEUTSCHMAN</h3>
<p>Ever since I can remember, I wanted to be part of the educational process. From an early age, I taught, coached, tutored and worked with people of all ages, working to inspire them to be their best self in the classroom, on a court and as a person. I was and still am a voracious reader, an inspired student and a passionate athlete. I had teachers, mentors and coaches who from an early age made an impact on my life thus I too am determined to inspire others to find their passion.
</p>
<p>
While educating our children is a serious and important intellectual endeavor, I am a true believer that there always needs to be an element of fun in the process. Fun does not always mean laughing, giggling or playing, to me the fun is feeling good about the process, being present and enjoying the moment. That is how one learns. It might take 1, 2 or 50 tries to grasp a skill, but the enjoyment is derived from the feeling of satisfaction that you are giving your best effort.</p>
<p>
Teaching by example is a very important educational tool. Everyday at Little dolphins I learn something new from my co founders, from our teachers, and from our young students. As a founder, I feel it is important to set the example of being an eternal student.</p>
<p>
One must never forget that the process of learning at any age is an adventure, a way of opening the mind and soul to new experiences. When you engage children at an early age, you lay a foundation, which stimulates and inspires curiosity and provides a solid foundation for lifelong learning.</p>
<p>
I am a member of the Princeton Class of ’83 and have two grown little dolphin alumni children and live in Pacific Palisades.</p>
