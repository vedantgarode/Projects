<h1>CURRICULUM</h1>
<h3>RESPECTING EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AS A FOUNDATION FOR LEARNING</h3>
<p>The curriculum at Little Dolphins By the Sea is unique among Los Angeles preschools. Each month, the entire school focuses on a different world culture: North America, Europe, Native America, Asia, Africa, India, and Latin America. Through exposure to authentic artifacts, materials, foods, texts, dances, and songs, students have profound cultural encounters, culminating in a school-wide festival where the children share their work with their parents and the larger community.</p>
<h3>MINDFULNESS</h3>
<p>As we facilitate children’s appreciation of global cultures, we integrate a mindfulness curriculum, helping students explore their autonomy and individuality, exercise self control, discover intrinsic motivations, work with enthusiasm and non-attachment to outcomes, and learn to collaborate with their peers. Through storytelling, we explore universal values, and connect literature to other areas of the curriculum, such as visual art, music, and theater. Each child learns respect for their own and their classmates’ art along the path of their own self-discovery.</p>
<p>Our curriculum is based on all of the following principles( condensed from The National Association for the Education of Young Children’s Reaching Potentials: Appropriate Curriculum and Assessment for Young Children, Vol. 1.)</p>
<ul><li>
Promote interactive learning and encourage the child's construction of knowledge.
</li><br>
<li>
Encourage active learning and allow children to make meaningful choices.
</li><br>
<li>
Foster children's exploration and inquiry, rather than focusing on "right" answers and "right" ways to complete a task.
</li><br>
<li>
Lead to conceptual understanding by helping children construct their own understanding in meaningful contexts.
</li><br>
<li>
Embody educational expectations in children that are realistic and attainable at this time, rather than push skills and knowledge that are more easily and efficiently acquired at a later time.
</li><br>
<li>
Encourage development of positive feelings and dispositions toward learning while leading to acquisition of knowledge and skills.
</li><br>
<li>
Help achieve social, emotional, physical, and cognitive goals.
</li><br>
<li>
Promote democratic values.
</li><br>
<li>
Promote and encourage social interaction among children and adults.
</li></ul>
<br>

<p>Mindfulness: We are deeply committed to encouraging individual and personal growth through:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Self-consciousness, Autonomy: Children are establishing a strong sense of individuality (especially following potty-training), discovering feelings and relating experiences to "me".
</li><br>
<li>
Self-control: The beginnings of "social" relations, praise for respecting the same needs in others as a result of problem solving.
</li><br>
<li>
Motivation: Initiative vs. guilt, exploring and accomplishing tasks with optimism, eliminate expectations by enthusiasm.
</li><br>
<li>
Social Ability: Enjoy working with peers and benefiting from it in the long run.
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>Concentration on the development of these attributes is done through:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Teaching non-violent means of problem solving.
</li><br>
<li>
Creating and implementing a dynamic curriculum that showcases the fine arts.
</li><br>
<li>
Creating a safe and nurturing environment.
</li><br>
<li>
Focusing attention on the arts for the purpose of instilling in children a sense of their own special creative powers.
</li><br>
<li>
Going the extra mile to provide a quality learning environment in which to create.
</li><br>
<li>
Exploring the diversity of our world.
</li><br>
<li>
Giving something back to the community.
</li><br>
<li>
Searching for excellence.
</li><br>
<li>
Strengthening the power of family relationships.
</li><br>
<li>
Having fun.
</li><br>
<li>
Creating art.
</li><br>
<li>
Using Bilingual Education via language-in-action.
</li><br>
<li>
Supporting children helping children.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>We achieve the above commitments by:</p>
<ul><li>
Using real images, photographs and authentic artifacts as visual displays.
</li><br>
<li>
Using nature and the materials it provides for art projects and productions.
</li><br>
<li>
Providing quality materials for art creation.
</li><br>
<li>
Incorporating similar global experiences throughout the yearly curriculum, e.g. weaving drums, storytelling and dance.
</li><br>
<li>
Organizing the setup of projects to facilitate the ease of accomplishment.
</li><br>
<li>
Including the extended family in the creation, preparation and presentation of our programs.
</li><br>
<li>
Recognizing that intellectual maturity does not equate with emotional maturity.
</li><br>
<li>
Having a teacher/student ratio of 6:1 younger groups and 9:1 older groups.
</li><br>
<li>
Remembering that children learn approximately 50% of their knowledge by the age of 4.
</li><br>
<li>
Remembering that HOW children create is more important than WHAT they create.
</li><br>
<li>
Listening to those who have more experience.
</li><br>
<li>
Collaborating with professional artists and trained educators.
</li><br>
<li>
Having mixed-age group classes in which younger children use older children as role models and older children can help younger children.</li></ul>

<h1>ACADEMICS<h1>
<h3>ALLOWING CHILDREN TO GROW SOCIALLY, EMOTIONALLY, PHYSICALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY</h3>
<p>Our preschool program emphasizes developmentally appropriate activities that allow children to grow socially, emotionally, physically, and intellectually. Our Academic time is spent in self-directed and meaningful creative play, based on a child's individual needs, as this builds the important foundational pillars for the future. Because learning begins with the senses—a child gathers meaning from the world through the experiences of touching, hearing, smelling, seeing, and tasting—our campus is a rich and stimulating, but never overwhelming, environment. The classroom has an open structure in which a child is free to choose individual areas of interest. All activities and learning are based on play.</p>
<div class="acadimg">

<h2>"A TEACHER IS NOT ONLY SOMEONE THAT TEACHES CHILDREN THEIR ABC'S"</h2>
<h3>A TEACHER IS SOMEONE WHO LISTENS TO A STORY ABOUT A CHILD'S NEW PUPPY, HELPS SOLVE A CONFLICT AMONG FRIENDS, TIES A PAIR OF SHOES, FINDS A SWEATSHIRT, HELPS A CHILD SOUND OUT THE NAME OF THEIR FAVORITE TOY, KISSES A BOO-BOO, AND GENUINELY LOVES AND CELEBRATES EACH ONE OF HER STUDENTS—ALL WHILE TEACHING THE ABC'S.</h3>
<p>- Amy Marston, "T.K." Teacher<p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>
The developmental approach to education allows children to progress at an individual pace. We respect each child’s uniqueness and take the time to learn about every student as an individual, constantly examining every step of the education process to adapt to our students and their needs. While our curriculum does outline fundamental goals for the various subject areas, we allow flexibility for each child to master the various skills according to his or her own readiness. We do not expect all children to learn the same things in the same way on the same day.
</p><p>
For preschool age children, providing age-appropriate instruction encourages curiosity and exploration. They experience real phenomena in their environment and work on in-depth projects that combine multiple disciplines. It is important for young learners to interact with the real and tangible and have direct sensory experiences. Experts also maintain that young children learn better when they have social interaction and can discuss their work with their peers. By providing such opportunities, developmentally appropriate learning creates a sound base of knowledge that is more retainable, and also provides a strong foundation for abstract learning later in life.</p>
<p>
Our program goals and activities are designed for age appropriateness. Only by staying within such parameters can our children truly succeed and achieve the sense of accomplishment that is part of the foundation of their learning. We create a rich environment designed for hands-on learning. Monthly cultural themes support long­ term excitement and immersion into an area through music, art, and more. The children participate in an organized group activity, and then move on to learning centers that provide the child an opportunity to make independent choices of their activities. Children are naturally inquisitive and learn through exploration. Through our learning centers, our children can exercise choice and control in order to further develop their interests and explore the world they live in. This will further expand their understanding of their role in a democratic society and allow them to practice problem solving, experience immediate feedback, and grapple with real-world challenges.</p>
<p>
We believe that a direct learning experience – fostered in a thoughtfully prepared learning environment like ours – is in fact the most powerful teacher. Therefore, we place the highest importance on experiential learning, due to the fact that children are naturally inquisitive, active learners who teach themselves from their explorations of their world. Thus, our classrooms, the materials in them, and the outdoor breakout spaces that make-up our campus – an oasis in urban Santa Monica – are designed to fully exploit these innate tendencies in our children. These rich real-life experiences begin in the preschool, which is why the fostering of play in a safe environment is so important and is at the crux of our minds-on curriculum, and hands-on teaching philosophy.
</p><p>
This method of teaching requires input, time, and energy. It requires us to be flexible and improvise with immediate changes that are developmentally characteristic of children at this age.</p>

<h1>THE ARTS</h1>
<h3>FOSTERING UNDERSTANDING THROUGH CULTURAL ENRICHMENT</h3>
<p>Little Dolphins By The Sea is a preschool that recognizes that the arts are fundamental to the development of children. It was founded to promote early imaginative learning through hands-on experiences in visual art, theatre, and music for the purpose of fostering understanding through cultural enrichment.</p>
<div class="art1">
<h2>
“LITTLE DOLPHINS IS A PLACE THAT NOURISHES AND LEADS YOUNG MINDS AND HEARTS
TO REACH THEIR FULL CREATIVE POTENTIAL AS CAPABLE, UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS. LITTLE DOLPHINS ENCOURAGES OUT-OF-THE-BOX THINKING THROUGH THE GIFT OF AN ARTS-BASED EDUCATION."</h2> <p>- LEIGH SCHINDLER, "COYOTES" TEACHER</p>
</div>
<h2>VISUAL ARTS</h2>
<h3>ART PROJECTS AS MECHANISMS FOR LEARNING</h3>
<p>Our curriculum incorporates amazing art projects as mechanisms for learning. Through “making,�? children become directly engaged with what they are learning and fully immersed in the subject at hand. By using the works of famous artists like: Miro, Chagall, Matisse, Munch, Picasso, Seurat, Calder, Braque, Kahlo, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Monet – to name a few – as educational points of departure, children are acquainted with subjects and then become immersed in themes typically associated with a higher age level of education. Through painting, collage, water-color, sketching, building, and construction – the children’s spatial awareness and sensitivity are triggered and a deeper level of intellectual and thematic thinking can be reached.</p>
<h2>MUSIC</h2>
<h3>MOVEMENT AND MUSIC ARE INTEGRAL FACETS OF OUR CURRICULUM</h3>
<p>
During our music and musical theatre classes, we introduce the basic components of theatrical expression while teaching the songs and performances are part of our daily circle time and our monthly festivals. Through storytelling and puppetry we teach them to express themselves with a combination of movement and music. Kids process information as they move; they learn letters, which become the rhythm of their larger motor-skills as they move in time and in harmony with their bodies. This supports thinking and language acquisition, as movement is a great way to access one’s working memory and encode new information in one’s long-term memory. When children connect certain movements with musical notes, they are able to memorize words more easily in another languages, as well as in English. Therefore, movement and music are very much tied together in our modes of instruction and are integral facets of our curriculum and educational programs.</p>
</div>
<div id="kinder">
<h1>TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN (T.K.)</h1>
<h3>A MULTICULTURAL CURRICULUM WITH A HANDS-ON APPROACH</h3>
<p>
Our purpose is to provide an approach for the development of academic skills by focusing on the whole child, which means taking into account each of their personalized needs. The TK program is five days a week from 8:45 a.m.– 3:00 p.m. for children ages 4.9 – 5.2 (four years and nine months to five years and two months) who may be in a transitional year between preschool and kindergarten.</p>
<p>
In the tradition of education implemented in the Little Dolphins By the Sea preschool program, the TK program offers a multicultural curriculum with a hands-on approach, designed to develop each child’s multiple intelligences. Our comprehensive educational program includes: language arts, math, science, computers, music, art, drama, physical education and movement. We strongly encourage parents of our students to become involved in every aspect of school life to make the student's educational experience that much more meaningful.</p>
<p>
We take a constructivist approach when it comes to our math and science curriculum, knowing that our students already have a substantial knowledge of the natural world. So when we teach math and science, the emphasis is that it is done through a hands-on exploration of art and play, which is a teaching methodology that is commonplace in the Maker’s Space community.
</p>
<p>
It is in the early childhood classroom where this kind of experience with the natural world must take place, allowing children to build experiences in investigation and problem solving and the foundation for understanding basic science concepts. This early science exploration can be a rich context in which children can use and develop other important skills including working with one another, basic large and small motor-controls, language learning, innovative thinking, and early mathematical understanding. Stimulating a child’s existing curiosity about the world s/he lives in, is a dynamic way to introduce new methodologies and encouraging that very curiosity that will make him or her an avid learner in the future.

<h1>MOVEMENT</h1>
<h3>AN ESSENTIAL MECHANISM FOR EXPRESSING FEELINGS AND COMMUNICATING</h3>
<p>
Another special area that Little Dolphins focuses on is movement. Movement is an essential mechanism for expressing feelings and communicating. This part of the curriculum supports both physical and emotional learning and is essential for early development. When children learn how to be within a space, it not only promotes coordination, but also the creation of new sensory bodily connections. Our outdoor campus is an important part of our movement curriculum program as it allows our children to move freely and with autonomy.</p>
<p>
Movement is allowed in all our instruction and during unstructured inside time. It is imperative to provide room and space that allow kids to move and to find themselves by becoming one with their bodies. This is necessary not only for the self-regulation of their bodies, but also for how they learn to express themselves through language and emotion. Encouraging movement is central to our teaching methodology.</p>
