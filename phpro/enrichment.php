			<h1>ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS</h1>
			<h3>OUR EDUCATIONAL PATHWAY</h3>
			<p>	As Little Dolphins By the Sea grew, and the Seven Arrows Way of Education expanded to include Seven Arrows Elementary School, a K-6 school in Pacific Palisades, we created the Roots & Wings program to serve the diverse needs of our community.<a href="#roots">Roots & Wings</a> which encompasses after-school enrichment classes and summer camps, including Global Outreach, a Spanish-immersion study-abroad and adventure-sport program designed for parents and their children, ages 10-18.</p>

				<h1>ROOTS & WINGS</h1>
				<h3>A RICH SET OF EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND COURSES</h3>
				<p>Roots & Wings started as an after school day care for pre-school families needing more childcare after the 1PM dismissal and eventually grew into a rich set of extra-curricular activities and courses up to 6th Grade level. Theatre, music, dance, Spanish, early academics, cooking, arts, and sports programming quickly became weekly after-school staples for our community of students and parents, with all offerings keeping in line with the Seven Arrows Way of Education. Currently, Little Dolphin’s Santa Monica campus offers the following enrichment classes for preschool students.</p>

				<p>Classes Include: Parent & Me, ABC Class, Alphabet Soup, Cooking and Spanish.</p>
				<p>
				The Seven Arrows Way is based on the profound pedagogy and philosophy of Experiential Learning. We ground our educational approach in leading-edge brain research. The Theory of Multiple Intelligences, developed at Harvard University by cognitive scientist Dr. Howard Gardner, holds that different people have diverse ways of learning, remembering, performing, processing, and understanding information. Gardner posits that there are seven distinct intelligences: Visual-Spatial, Bodily-Kinesthetic, Musical, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, Linguistic, and Logical-Mathematical. Our curriculum is designed to explore these intelligences, and to identify each child’s individual learning style, in order to optimize his or her educational results.

				<h2 style="font-family:'Bungee';padding-left:30px;padding-top:30px;">ABC CLASS</h2>
				<p style="padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;padding-bottom:30px;">(Optional for current Little Dolphins students)
				Children explore the exciting world of letters and numbers in this pre-kindergarten learning class, which becomes their first introduction to the academic world. The goal is to bring the alphabet to life; the class is designed to tap into each child's natural curiosity to learn and to have fun (play at this age) while doing it! The ABC Class provides a structured environment designed to ease the transition from preschool to transitional kindergarten, which not only helps children identify the alphabet and learn numbers, but also aids those who are developmentally ready to master the skill of reading and writing. This is done through teaching the whole language of learning. Children will learn to focus, have critical thinking, and strengthen their memory, which is a skill that will be critical in their learning.<br><br>
				Children should show an interest in learning about these areas before entering the class. This class is available to children ages 4 ½ years and up or to children who are developmentally ready for this program. The ABC Class hours are 1:00 p.m. – 2:45 p.m., Monday – Thursday.</p>

				This class introduces children to different foods from around the world. We discuss where they come from, what their cultural meaning represents, and more importantly, how to prepare them. Each week a new food dish + origin country is chosen – one that is healthy, as well as simple to make — and allows children to engage in hands-on food preparation, all in the aim of bringing the fun IN and the mystery OUT of the art of cooking. Skills fostered in this class include: independence, focus, listening, and most of all being open to trying new foods each week. This is a fun and engaging class that will help children learn to focus and understand the world of academics, through numbers and simple math, served up of cooking and movement. Following direction, as well as developing listening skills, and hand-eye hand coordination are all skills that are as important as knowing the alphabet for feeling successful academically. Note: we are able to accommodate children with food allergies. Tuesday, 1:00 – 2:00 p.m.</p>

				<h1>GLOBAL FESTIVALS</h1>
				<h3>PROMOTING GLOBAL CONVERSATION, LEARNING AND INSIGHT</h3>
				<p>Global Festivals is a speaker series that unites artists and scientists alike to visit the Seven Arrows Elementary and Little Dolphins by the Sea communities to listen to the greatest living thinkers alive, talk about life in an intimate and special setting.</p><p>
				Open to both the families of our preschool and elementary – as well as to our alumni and the greater communities of Pacific Palisades and Santa Monica – we invite influential cross-disciplinary speakers from all over the world to come share their intellectual and social capital with our school. We do this in the spirit of promoting global conversation, learning, and insight, as thought-leaders in the educational space. Visitors have included: Dr. Jane Goodall, Dr. James Watson, Isabelle Allende, Dr. Howard Gardner, PhD., Dr. Judy Willis, Neuroscientist, Ned Hallowell, M.D., and celebrated writer Ray Bradbury, to name a few.
